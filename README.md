Introduction:

In the ever-evolving automobile industry, data-driven decisions play a pivotal role in success. I recently had the opportunity to work on a data analysis project that involved a dataset from an automobile car company. This project aimed to gain insights into various aspects of the industry, from pricing trends to fuel efficiency and more.

Tools Used:

SQL Server for data extraction, transformation, and storage.

Tableau for data visualization, creating interactive dashboards, and generating insights.

Key Objectives:

Trends in car sales over the years

The impact of factors like mileage, fuel type, and seller type on selling prices

Popular car models and their characteristics

Distribution of cars by owner type and transmission type
